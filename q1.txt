Used node.js and express.js for backend.

-Installed all required modules.
-Created a sample dataset in products.json
-Created a server.js to implement POST, Get operations for registering company, then generating authentication token. Then retrieve data of a particular company of a particular category and in the specified range of value.

My server is running successfully but i feel there is some error in my code by which the code is not retrieving data correctly.
